在写完上一个“抽奖器”后，我便打算写这个,其实两者差不多，但是这个程序复杂一些。
主要是想实现了让学生可以随机抽取座位（在我中学的时候有的老师按照自己的想法换位置，有的老师按照固定的方式换，还有的则是抽签。)
虽然我已经大学了已经用不上了，但是还是迫不及待的写了它，(当时仍然没有开始学习java，整体能力不高，还好vb非常容易上手)
虽然最后也没有什么人用……

After I code last program for teacher,I plan to code it.These two program may be similar,but it more complex.
The function is making classmates to get their seat randomly(When I was in middle school and high school,the teacher change the seat just by their thoughts or some same ways or drawing lots).
Although I am a college student when I code it, I still eager to code it.(I did not study Java at that time,and I am not so good at programming.It is luck that vb is very easy to study) .
Although no one will use it at last......
